# CODE CHALLENGE PHASE 2 WEEK 2

# Description

The code challenge for week one of phase two was to create a react app that fetches data from a server which was rendered whose data is from https://drive.google.com/file/d/157IfYxr4Bp63-ByF1g1wCP1uOpQ5i2R4/view. The proejct deliverables are as below: 

# Project Deliverables:

As a user, I should be able to:
- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.

- Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking
  on the card should instead display a show view (`BotSpecs`) for that bot,
  which should replace `BotsCollection`. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one
  to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot. Your app could
  look like the following:

- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
- When I enlist a bot it will be **removed** from the `BotCollection` and added
  to `YourBotArmy`.
- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
- Only enlist **one** bot from each `bot_class`. The classes are
  `["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"]`.
